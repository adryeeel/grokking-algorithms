# Chapter 01: Introduction to Algorithms

The first chapter of Grokking Algorithms introduces the programmer to the concept of algorithms and demonstrates how they can expedite results simply by altering the underlying logic. Furthermore, this chapter delves into algorithm performance, discussing methods for comparison using big O notation and logarithmic time complexity to ascertain their efficiency.

## Binary Search

The primary algorithm showcased is the binary search. The book initially make readers familiar with the search problem, using a phone book as an illustrative example. The task entails locating the number of a person whose name begins with 'K'.

To solve this, two methods were shown:

- **Linear search**: A name by name search, from the start until the end. If the book ended in K, this would involve searching through the entire phone book. How long would this take in a thousand page book?

- **Binary search**: A search starting in the middle. Because K is known to be closer to the middle, this approach eliminates all possibilities between the beginning and middle of the book, speeding up the search, as we don't have to search for names that certainly don't start with K.

Of course, the most logic option is the second one.

The essence of a binary search lies in efficiently narrowing down possibilities with each operation. This is achieved by comparing the search value with two positions within a sorted list.

If the search value is closer to the end of the list, we eliminate all values from the start to the middle and proceed to search from the middle to the end. Conversely, if it's closer to the beginning, we search from the start to the middle and eliminate all values from the middle to the end.

However, for this algorithm to function effectively, the list must be sorted in some manner. This is precisely why the phone book serves as a fitting example &ndash; it's typically sorted alphabetically.

## Algorithm Performance

## Implementation

The book implementation uses Python as official language due its easy sintax. However, I developed using C as language and built two versions of this algorithm: a [iterative](binary_search.c) and a [recursive](binary_seach_rec.c). You can access them by selecting which one do you want see ðŸ˜‰.

You can also see this algorithm implementation for many (many!) other languagues in the author's repository: [Grokking Algorithms](https://github.com/egonSchiele/grokking_algorithms). Check it out for your favorite language.
